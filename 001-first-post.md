Greetings to my vast army of followers.

This is yet another new blog.  As the name implies, I will use it to
show and critique bad "memes".

In its original meaning, a ["meme"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) is "an
idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within
a culture".  The word was coined by Richard Dawkins in his book
"The Selfish Gene".  The idea is that an idea can exist, replicate,
and spread through a population in much the same manner as a gene can.
(Of course the idea of a "meme" is itself a meme.)

More recently, the word has been applied more specifically to
["image macros"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro), generally
images with superimposed text.  Such things are endemic on Facebook
and other social media sites.  There are web sites that let you
generate your own, picking or uploading an image and superimposing
your own text.  This is the kind of meme I'll be discussing here.

I see several problems with this trend.

* These memes are very often inaccurate.  I've seen this from both
  ends of the political spectrum.

* Even if the statement in a meme is accurate, it's often superimposed
  on an image of a particular prominent person who didn't make the
  statement, presumably in an attempt to make it more plausible.

* Embedding text in an image is problematic for several reasons.
  It can't be automatically translated, so it's available only to
  speakers of a particular language (almost always English in the ones
  I've seen).  Text in an image can't be copy-and-pasted, making it
  difficult to verify or refute whatever statements are being made.
  It can't be processed by screen readers, making it inaccessible to
  people who are visually impaired.

Unfortunately, Facebook makes it very easy to re-post images, and
Twitter doesn't count the size of an image against the 140-character
limit, making an image the easiest way to tweet a long message.
(And even purely textual tweets are routinely shared on Facebook as
screen shots.)

I'll be collecting and posting Bad Memes as I run across them.
Watch this space.

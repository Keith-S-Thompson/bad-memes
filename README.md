This repository contains the content for my upcoming blog,
[Bad Memes](http://bad-memes.blogspot.com/).

This blog will show examples of so-called "memes", those images
with embedded text that are commonly posted to Facebook and other
social media sites.  I will critique them both for content and for
presentation.  I've seem some *very* bad examples (from both ends of
the political spectrum).
